When I first got into 40s, the loss of punctuation, arrow keys, and weird mod sizes meant a steep learning curve and a struggle to find compatible keycaps. This is why I created Fruitbar; with a fun name and a fun size, Fruitbar is aimed to make your introduction to 40s as smooth and accessible as possible.
